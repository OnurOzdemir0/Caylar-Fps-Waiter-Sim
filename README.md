# Caylar-Fps-Waiter-Sim
Çaylar is a first-person shooter (FPS) waiter game that was created for OzU Game Jam 1 using Unreal Engine 5.1, under 48 hours. The game was inspired by the Ayak İşleri episode where Vedat becomes a waiter in a köfteci for 4 years, which was actually a hypnosis episode for Vedat, so he was just dreaming for 6 hours. In Çaylar, customers either want a köfte or a tea.

## Story of The Jam

I have been recently playing Plates Up, so I wanted to make a game about managing customers. Jam Theme was: "Start Small", so I thought of a game where player is a waiter that eventually gets superpowers (dash, double jump etc.) as they progress through the game.

I first tried making this level from the Ayak İşleri S2 E7:

Which turned out like this, with the God Rays:  -I was going to add more windows-

Then I thought that this was looking too fancy for the "start small" theme. So I started to make another level. 

This is a classic Turkish "Kahvehane" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94066846/229530652-649f9030-0d28-4fee-a6d1-859cbb400025.png)

Turned out like this:

## Note
Çaylar is a work in progress and may have some unfinished or unpolished elements. Additionally, the second level may not be fully functional. Various free to use assets were used in the making of the game.
